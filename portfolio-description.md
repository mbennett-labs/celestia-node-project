# Celestia Light Node Project for Portfolio

## Project Title
**Celestia Light Node Implementation with Resource-Optimized Monitoring**

## Short Description
A professional implementation of a Celestia Light Node with a real-time monitoring dashboard, optimized for VPS environments where resource management is critical.

## Technologies Used
- Celestia Blockchain (Light Node)
- Go 1.21+
- Node.js & Express
- EJS Templating
- Systemd Service Management
- Linux Resource Management
- SSH Tunneling for Secure Access

## Key Features
- **Resource-Optimized Node**: Configured to run efficiently on a shared VPS with minimal impact on co-hosted services
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Custom dashboard for node health, performance metrics, and log monitoring
- **Professional Deployment**: Properly daemonized with systemd for production-level reliability
- **Security-Focused**: No direct exposure to public internet, accessible only via SSH tunnel
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Full installation and configuration guides

## Challenge Solved
This project demonstrates how to run a blockchain node on a shared resource environment without compromising the performance of other hosted services. It showcases both blockchain infrastructure expertise and system administration skills by implementing proper resource controls and monitoring.

## Technical Details to Highlight
- Implementation of systemd resource limits to constrain memory and CPU usage
- Creation of a lightweight monitoring dashboard using Node.js
- Secure remote access implementation via SSH tunneling
- Professional log management and analysis
- Participation in a cutting-edge modular blockchain network (Celestia)
- Production-quality daemonization and service management

## Portfolio Presentation Tips
1. **Include Screenshots**: Add actual dashboard screenshots showing the node in operation
2. **Emphasize Resource Management**: Highlight the technical aspects of running a blockchain node in a resource-constrained environment
3. **Showcase Complete Solution**: Present this as a full-stack implementation from node setup to monitoring
4. **Highlight Blockchain Knowledge**: Emphasize understanding of Celestia's modular blockchain architecture
5. **Demonstrate DevOps Skills**: Point out the professional deployment aspects (systemd, resource management, security)
